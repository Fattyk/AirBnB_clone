# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

### The console is the first part of the AirBnB project which helps in managing the following operations:
* define parent class that can be inherited from other classes
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization
* Creates classes needed for AirBnB projects
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project
* create all unittests to validate classes and storage engine
